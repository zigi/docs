# Pop Conflict Resolution

There are two potential solutions that may be used to create a clean workspace:

-   Create a new stash from the workspace, and then pop the desired stash.
-   Perform the following actions:
    1.  AddAll to add all untracked and modified data sets and files to the Git index staging area.
    2.  Commit those changes.

After performing either of the above, the pop should work.
