# Add Binary \(AB\) Function

This topic explains the Add Binary \(AB\) function.

The Add Binary \(AB\) function adds the entire data set as binary data. This includes tagging the OMVS copy of the data set with the binary tag \(chtag\) and updating the .gitattributes file. If the data set is a PDS that contains both text and binary members: S or A the entire data set, select the PDS from the **Current Repository** panel, and then from the Member list AB the individual members that are in binary format.
