# Adding a Remote Repository

ZIGI currently only supports a single remote \(origin\) per repository. Once you have a local repository, you can use the remote command to add this single remote to your local repository.

To do so, the remote repository \(GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, etc.\) needs to associate the public part of your Mainframe ssh key pair with the userID for the remote repository service. Once you’ve set up the repository on the remote side, you can add the remote within ZIGI. A push – u origin master is performed.
