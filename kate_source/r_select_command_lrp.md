# Select Command

This topic explains the Select command.

If you donâ€™t want to Tab to a row, do one of the following:

-   Move the cursor to a row
-   Use point-and-shoot
-   Enter S to select a repository

There is a command option to directly select a repository to be opened.

Syntax: Select repository-name

Select may be abbreviated as S and must be followed by the repository name.

**Tip:** For the Select command, the search is case insensitive.
