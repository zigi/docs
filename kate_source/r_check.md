# Check Command

This topic explains the functionality of the Check command.

The Check command checks all z/OS data sets, based on the last reference date from the data set control block \(DSCB\), to determine if the data has changed since the repository was opened. This is useful if the repository has been open for a period of time and the repository's data sets have been updated outside of ZIGI.
