# Dovetail Enhancements

ZIGI now supports the Dovetail enhanced getpds and putpds commands. These commands significantly speed up the copying of PDS members between the OMVS filesystem and the z/OS partioned data sets.

The use of the Co:Z Toolkit is subject to Dovetail's [Community License](https://dovetail.com/docs/cozinstall/licenses.html).

Along with the getpds and putpds, which greatly enhances ZIGI, there are also:

-   Co:Z SFTP
-   Co:Z Launcher
-   Co:Z Dataset Pipes
-   Co:Z Batch

These commands are not fully exploited with the ZIGI 3.10 release as there are more capabilities available with them.

**Note:** This is optional. The standard OMVS cp command is used if these commands are not available.
