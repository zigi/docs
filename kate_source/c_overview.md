# Overview \(What You Should Know but May Not\)

This topic provides a description of Git and ZIGI.

Git is a version control system that has been very popular in the distributed environment. Thanks to the great team over at Rocket Software, it is available \(and has been for a few years\) for the z/OS environment. The main drawback is there has not been a user-friendly, mainframe-based solution until now. ZIGI allows the mainframe developer to participate in the world of Git. There is a wealth of information available on Git. Open your favorite web browser and do a search or go directly to [github.com](http://github.com) where free accounts and many open source projects, including ZIGI, are available.

ZIGI was developed to provide the mainframe developer with a user-friendly interface to Git that works the way any other mainframe user interface works, making it possible for the developer to continue to use the development tools that are familiar, easy to use, and that enhance their productivity. That means that all of the ISPF capabilities are available to the ZIGI user as well as the ability to integrate their SCM requirements using Git.
