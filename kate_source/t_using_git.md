# Using Git

This topic explains how to use Git.

1.  Create an account at GitHub.com, and then add your \(Mainframe\) SSH Public Key to your account.

2.  If you have not added your SSH keys to your GitHub settings, provide your username and password at the prompt.

    It is highly recommended that you add your public SSH key to your GitHub account settings to eliminate the prompts for userid and password.

3.  Sign into OMVS, and then change to the directory where you are installing ZIGI.

4.  Do one of the following:

    -   If your SSH key is already generated and added to your GitHub account, execute the following command:

        ```
        git clone git@github.com:wizardofzos/zigi.git
        cd zigi
        sh install.sh
        ```

    -   If you havenâ€™t added your SSH key to Github clone via https, execute the following command:

        ```
        git clone https://github.com/wizardofzos/zigi.git
        [provide GitHub username and password when prompted]
        cd zigi
        sh install.sh
        ```
