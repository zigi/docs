# Stash

Stash saves \(pushes\) your current Git workspace and restores the workspace to the last commit level. This allows you to quickly switch what youâ€™re working on and work on something else without forcing a commit.

**Note:** A stash is never pushed to the remote server. Enter a short description on the **zigi Prompt Popup** screen since you may have multiple stashes in your project.
