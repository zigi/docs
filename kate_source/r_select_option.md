# Select Option

The Select option, or point-and-shoot, performs one of two different actions depending upon the type of data set being selected. After editing a sequential data set, if the data has changed, it is copied down to the OMVS file.

Open an Edit member list for a PDS. See [The ZIGI PDS Member List](c_the_zigi_pds_member_list.md) for more information.

If the selected file is an OMVS directory, then ZIGI opens that directory and displays it using the Current Repository routines.
