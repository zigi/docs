# Appendix E: Common Problems

This is a partial list of common problems you may encounter:

-   Failure in the cp command attempting to copy a z/OS data set, or z/OS PDS member, to USS. This is typically caused by the z/OS data set being opened \(for example: ISPF Browse\).
-   Failure using the Clone or Remote ZIGI commands due to an access failure. This may be caused by your ssh public key on the active LPAR not being registered with the remote server.
